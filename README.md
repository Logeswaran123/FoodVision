# Food Vision
Food Vision 101 is a dataset consisting of 101k images belonging to **101 classes** of food.

## Objective
1. Split the 101k image data of 101 classes into train and test splits.
2. Build a CNN model using feature extraction method.
3. Fine tune the model from (1) by unfreezing the layers. Since, we have large dataset it is good to unfreeze all the layers.
4. Build a streamlit application to upload image, and run prediction on uploaded image using model from (2). Display Top-5 classes of predictions.
